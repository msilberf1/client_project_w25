                CEW+
            </h2>

            <p>At CEW+, we navigate circumstantial barriers by providing academic, financial, and professional support to help you reach your personal potential. Established to support women through higher education, we lift up women and all under-served communities at U-M and beyond. Through career and education counseling, funding, workshops, events, and a diverse, welcoming community, we exist to empower. We are CEW+, and we're here to help you reach your potential.</p>
            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>History:</strong> Established in 1964, the Center for the Education of Women+ was a pioneering university women's center. Designed to serve the needs of women students as well as women returning to school or work, CEW+ (then known as the Center for the Continuing Education of Women) was founded with a three-part mission of service, advocacy, and research. The Center for the Education of Women+ (now known as CEW+) continues its work today, serving University students, staff and faculty, community members, and all genders, facing education, employment, or other life issues.</li>
                <li><strong>What We Do:</strong> CEW+ provides immediate and ongoing services and the financial support needed to ensure educational success and degree completion. Women+ and under-served students are CEW+'s primary constituency, but all students are welcome. CEW+ also serves those who encounter education and career obstacles based on their non-linear paths to, and experiences within, the University community.</li>
                <li><strong>DEI:</strong> Since 1964, CEW+ has worked to remove obstacles that impact women and other marginalized groups at U-M. CEW+ has also served as a bridge for returning students and community college transfers and fought for family-friendly policies that have benefited both men and women. Our understanding of the challenges faced by under-served students and underrepresented faculty and staff allows us to contribute greatly to diversity at U-M by providing supports and resources that are responsive to the emerging needs of these groups.</li>
