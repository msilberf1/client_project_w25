            <h2>Academic Advising</h2>
            <p>Academic advising is a process where students envision, execute, and reflect on their academic plans with guidance from a qualified UMSI Academic Advisor. Students share their goals, challenges, and questions with their academic advisor, and their academic advisor contributes knowledge of university and program requirements, policies, and processes. Together, they develop an academic plan that aligns with the student's personal and professional goals. <a href = "https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/bsiacademicadvising/home">Academic Advising</a> resources can be found here.</p>
